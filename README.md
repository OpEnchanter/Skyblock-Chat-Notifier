## Skyblock Chat Notifier
A simple mod that lets you create titles triggered by chat messages.

**Usage**
1. Simply add a trigger (make sure it matches the exact text shown in chat except for colors)
2. See title on your screen whenever that text shows up in chat!

*Example (Whenever the text "Trigger text" appears in chat "Message on screen" would appear in the center of the screen)*
